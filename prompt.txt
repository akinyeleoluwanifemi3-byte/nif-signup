Please generate a full responsive frontend developer portfolio website with the following detailed specifications:

General Setup
Use HTML5, fully semantic structure, with language attribute lang="en".

Use Tailwind CSS loaded via CDN for styling.

Load Google Fonts for the "Inter" font family with weights from 300 to 900.

Include FontAwesome CDN for icon fonts (version 6.4.2).

The entire webpage background color is very dark (#0a0a0a), with light text (#e2e8f0).

The webpage uses a custom animated cursor with two elements: a small dot (8px) and a larger outlined circle (40px), both tracking mouse movement with smooth easing and scaling effects on hover.

Scrollbar is customized: 8px wide, track background #0a0a0a, thumb is #4f46e5 with rounded corners, changing to #6366f1 on hover.

The entire page content is initially hidden behind a full-screen split-screen loader animation.

Loader Animation
Full viewport fixed overlay with two black halves side-by-side, each half expands in width scale up to about 166% over about 1 second, simultaneously advancing a visible percentage counter from 0% to 100% in increments of 1% every 10 milliseconds.

After reaching 100%, the left half translates fully left (-100%) and the right half fully right (100%) out of view with a 1-second transition.

Then the loader overlay disappears, revealing the main site content with a fade-in effect.

Homepage Content Structure & Styling
Header / Navbar
Fixed top with padding that shrinks on scroll from 1.5rem to 1rem vertical and horizontal.

Background transitions to translucent dark (rgba(17,24,39,0.7)) on scroll.

Contains site logo text "daniel." on the left, styled with bold, white text and an indigo hover highlight.

Navigation links (Home, About, Experience, Projects, Education, Contact) appear horizontally on medium+ screens, with subtle color fade from slate-300 to white on hover.

A "Let's Talk" call-to-action button with indigo gradient background and scale on hover is visible on medium+ screens.

On mobile screens, a hamburger menu toggles a vertical navigation menu with subtle glassmorphism effect and same link styling.

Hero Section
Minimum full viewport height, vertically and horizontally centered text with generous horizontal padding.

Background includes a subtle animated gradient overlay with about 20% opacity behind content.

Main heading: "Hi, I'm daniel" with large gradient text from cyan-400 to blue-500 (gradient clipped in text).

Subtitle below: "Frontend Developer Ready to Build Your Next Product." in gray text.

Description paragraph describing recent graduate skills in HTML, CSS, JS, React.

A prominent rounded CTA button "Let's Connect" with cyan-to-blue gradient background.

Floating brand icons scattered around the hero area representing technologies: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, React, Java, Code icon, Python, Node.js — all positioned absolutely with distinct colors and sizes (5xl).

The hero text and button animate in on page load with fade and vertical motion using GSAP easing.

Skills Marquee Section
A horizontally scrolling marquee effect with repeated skill keywords: “Three.js”, “React”, “GSAP”, “Tailwind CSS”, “Next.js”, “Framer Motion”, “WebGL”.

The marquee text uses large font size (4xl), bold, with muted slate-500 color.

The marquee loops infinitely with smooth linear left-to-right animation lasting about 25 seconds per cycle.

Two duplicate sets of marquee text are placed side by side for seamless infinite scroll.

About Section
Two-column grid on medium+ screens:

Left side: A rounded square image container with glassmorphism effect (semi-transparent dark background with blur) housing a programmer image (provided URL).

Right side: Title "Passionate Frontend Developer" in large bold font (5xl).

Two paragraphs describing the passion for creating fast, beautiful web apps, combining design and code, always learning.

On mobile the order is preserved with the image stacked on top.

Portfolio Section (circular style)
Section with dark background (#0f0f10) and light text.

Header area with:

Subtitle text "Projects" in smaller slate-500 color.

Large title "Practice makes perfect."

Description text about valuing quality work over quantity.

A circular rotating text around a circle border reading repeatedly "Portfolio — Portfolio — Portfolio — …" in pale color (#cbd5e1).

Inside the circle is bold large text "1+" representing years of freelance & development experience, with descriptive text below.

Experience Section (timeline style)
Centered vertical timeline bar in the middle with slates-700 color line.

Experience entries placed alternately left and right on medium+ screens, with circles marking points on the timeline line.

Each experience block has a glass-effect background with padding and rounded corners.

Three timeline items:

2022-Present: Lead Frontend Developer at Stellar Solutions Inc., tasks include developing 3D product visualizers with Three.js and React, improving engagement by 40%, maintaining component library with Tailwind CSS.

2020-2022: Senior Frontend Developer at Quantum Dynamics, specializing in data visualizations and GSAP animations.

Projects Section (horizontal scroll)
Title centered: "Featured Projects"

A horizontally scrollable container pinned on scroll, where projects scroll horizontally triggered by vertical page scroll.

Each project card is a glass-effect rounded rectangle with padding and containing:

Large icon representing project category (cube, chart-line, cart-shopping, gamepad) colored distinctively.

Project title and a brief description.

Four project cards:

3D Configurator with Three.js

Data Viz Platform with D3.js and React

E-commerce Site with Next.js

WebGL Game with browser-based WebGL graphics

Education Section

Contact Section
Centered heading "Let's Build the Future"

Paragraph inviting projects or connections

Footer
Centered copyright text & tagline

“© 2025 CodeWithdaniel. All rights reserved.”

“Designed & Built with futuristic vibes.”

Styles & Effects
Use glassmorphism style for multiple containers (dark translucent background with 10px blur and white transparent border).

Use subtle GSAP scroll-triggered fade and slide animations for section titles and content:

Elements reveal from below or sides with easing as they enter viewport.

Use GSAP ScrollTrigger to create:

Navbar padding and background color transition on scroll.

Hero text fade and scale entrance animations.

Horizontal scroll pinning effect for the projects section, moving projects track horizontally as user scrolls vertically.

Animate the circular "Portfolio" text to continuously rotate clockwise at about 0.6 degrees per animation frame.

Custom Cursor
A small dot and a larger outlined circle that follow mouse position smoothly using GSAP with easing timings.

Cursor outline expands and changes border color when hovering on any link or button.

The cursor elements should not interfere with pointer events.

Background
Implement a Three.js starfield background behind all content:

5000 randomly positioned particles in a 3D cube space.

Particles colored #4c51bf with partial transparency.

Camera moves slowly in response to mouse movement for parallax effect.

Particles slowly rotate around X and Y axes with time.

Other
The page must be fully responsive with appropriate stacking on smaller screens and two-column layouts on larger screens.

Include smooth scrolling behavior for intra-page navigation.

All interactive elements have appropriate hover and focus states.

Provide a fully working, modern, clean, and polished web portfolio front-end code using the above instructions, including HTML, CSS (Tailwind utility classes and some custom styles), JavaScript for GSAP animations, Three.js background, and custom cursor behavior exactly as described.
